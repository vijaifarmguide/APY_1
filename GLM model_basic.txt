Linear Reg
Polynomial Reg

L1,l2 Regularization

The least-square fit, model

Table :State ,District,season, year ,area ,production,yield

q-q graph for linearity (4 graphs)

graph :y(crop),x(prod or yield)
graph :y(dis),x(prod or yield)
graph :y(prod or yield),x(time)   (agg of crops one line), many lines

correlation b/w target and independent variable


Descrptive stats
The order of highest yield agriculture crops are Sugar cane, rice, Cotton, Ground Nut and Maize, Coconut, Banana and Dry Chillies etc.

The districts with high yield in Andhra Pradesh state are West Godavari, Krishna, East Godavari, etc


The conditions associated
with model include, 1. Linearity, 2. Nearly normal
residuals and 3. Constant variability.


Residual = Observed value – Predicted value e = y – y
Compute the Residual Sum of Squares and Obtain the R2
